*A Demo Erlang/LFE REST App for Google Cloud Platform Custom Runtimes*


## Introduction

This project was lovingly copied from
[cloudy](https://github.com/oubiwann/cloudy),
the sample project created as part of the
[LFE Presntation for Erlang Factory 2014](http://www.erlang-factory.com/sfbay2014/duncan-mcgreggor).
It has since been adapted for use as a demo of the
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)'s
[Custom Runtimes](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/managed-vms/custom-runtimes)
in the
[tutorial featured in the LFE blog]().
